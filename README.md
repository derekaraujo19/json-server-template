# JSON Server - Backend for Derek Araujo's Personal Web App

Welcome to my personal web page! This site is designed to be my business card, resume, and media hub all rolled up into one application. The frontend repository can be found here: [github.com/derekaraujo19/araujo-web-app](https://github.com/derekaraujo19/araujo-web-app)

A video walkthrough of the application running can be found [here](https://youtu.be/lD-KjGSY7kE).

## Data

The data in this db.json file contains music credits (listed as 'projects'), images, and comment data, which is getting submitted via a form request in the Comments component.

The music links, located at 'projects.player,' take you to invidiual Spotify tracks, and are played via a Spotify embedded link player in the app.

'Artwork' and 'Year' data are placeholders and are not currently being used in this build.
